$F_{st}$ is arguably one of the most widely used statistics in population genetics, where it is most often used to calculate the genetic distance between populations, to measure population structure, and to test for whether a locus is under divergent selection between populations.

Another way to think about $F_{st}$ is as the amount of drift accumulated in a population. You see, Wright, the OG population geneticist, imagined $F_{st}$ as the correlation between randomly drawn alleles in a subpopulation, relative to the total population. This 'total population' is typically assumed to mean the combined population but I prefer Weir and Hill's interpretation where the total population is the ancestral population from which the subpopulations descended.
