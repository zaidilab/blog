Arslan is an assistant professor in the Department of Genetics, Cell, and Developmental Biology and a core member of the Institute of Health Informatics. He received his PhD in Genetics, with a minor in Statistics, from Penn State with Mark Shriver in 2016. He was a postdoc with Kateryna Makova (2016-2018) and then an NIH K99/R00 postdoc with Iain Mathieson (2019-2022). Besides his research interests, he is interested in making statistical genetics accessible. You can read more on his blog.

Parisa is an MS student in BICB. She received her bachelor's in statistics from The University of Tabriz, and her masters in biostatistics from Tarbiat Modares University in Iran. Then she studied the effects of assortative mating on complex traits in the Irani population under the supervision of Mahdi Akbarzadeh at Shahid Beheshti University. She is now studying the genetic architecture of mtDNA gene expression.
