## Population genetics of complex traits

Welcome! This blog originally started when I was a graduate student as a way for me to clarify concepts in statistical genetics that I thought were confusing or not well-explained in books/papers. I never posted very often but some of the things that I did write seemed helpful to students. I'm going to try to continue writing, now with the help of my current students/trainees who are learning with me. So I hope you find it useful. :-)
